This is a problem I found while looking through job interview questions.

"Consider a number 123, the product of the number with its digits (123 * 1 * 2 *
3 = 738) is 738. Therefore, 123 is a seed product of 738. Write a program to
accept a number and find all possible seed products. For example, if the user
entered 4977 then the answer should be 79 and 711."

I wrote a solution in Java. It takes an integer as a command line argument and
prints out the product seeds of that number.
